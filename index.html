        <p>Hi, I'm Cassie! There's not much to say about me besides the fact that I LOVE life! This world is
            absolutely marvelous, and I'm so grateful for the chance to be in it! I've been looking forward to this
            class and am so ready to begin my educational journey!</p>
        <p>P.S. Meet my sweet puppy Dixie! She's a mini aussi-doodle and I absolutely adore her!</p>

        <img src="images/eagle.jpg" alt="An eagle with an American flag.">
        <p>I hail from these great United States of America ('Murica' as we like to call it). We eat hot dogs and McDonald's for each and every supper, 
            and dump tea into any available body of water. Our domesticated bald eagles tend to isolate themselves at the top of the tallest Redwood trees until the 4th of July,
            when they perform an armored arial show alongside our colorful explosives. In all actuality though, I do love the US.</p>
